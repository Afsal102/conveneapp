# Convene Handbook

Thank you all for joining this project! I'm excited to see what we can build here. This readme will outline some ideas for how we can make this work, but remember, this is all up to change, and if you have any ideas on how to do something better I would love to hear them!

## Convene Roadmap
- [ ] Make current code fully tested
- [ ] Add ratings and reviews for each book
- [ ] To be announced

## How this project will work?
Short answer is we will figure it out as we go, but I have created a starting point for something we can work with. If you think there is some way we can do things better, please let me know.
#### Proposals and Ideas
There is a template for proposals, use this for any idea or proposal for what you would like to see in the application. Or in the project in general.
* For every accepted proposal, 1 point will be rewarded.

### Tasks
The workflow for accomplishing tasks should look like this: 
1. Select task you want to work on
2. Assign it to yourself
3. Complete the task
4. Create a pull request
5. Wait for 2 reviewers to code review your task

Rules:
* If your code is blocking other people work, need to give daily updates as a comment on the issue, or it will be assigned to someone else.

### Code Reviews
Code reviewers will be expected to assign themselves to any code reviews that they deem capable of reviewing. Once you selected the code to review, assign yourself as a reviewer and you will have 24 hours to complete the code review.

* Reviewer gets 1 point for finding a bug during a review

Total point summary
|Task Type|Task|Points|
|-|-|-|
|AP|Accepted Proposal|1|
|BF|Bug Found (during review)|1|
|LF|Large Feature|4|
|MF|Medium Feature|3|
|SF|Small Feature|2|
|LB|Large Bug Fix|3|
|MB|Medium Bug Fix|2|
|SB|Small Bug Fix|1|

Current Points will be recorded in points.md, and must be updated during your task or by me for AP and BF.

All points are subject to change, and sometimes there might be tasks that will have to overrule the point system.
